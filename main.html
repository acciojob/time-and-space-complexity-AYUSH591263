<h1>Time, Space, Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time complexity is a measure of the amount of time an algorithm takes to complete as a function of the input size. It helps us analyze how efficient an algorithm is in terms of execution time, especially as the input grows.</p>
 <p><b>Space Complexity</b> is <b>O(n)</b>, meaning the memory usage grows linearly with the input.</p>
